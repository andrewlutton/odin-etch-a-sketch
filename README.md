# odin-etch-a-sketch

Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

Demonstrating basic foundational HTML, CSS, Javascript skills learned in The Odin Project foundations curriculum

For now, this fulfills all the requirements of the project. I'm not super thrilled with it. Some future changes after I develop my skills more:

    -Update the CSS to have a nice presentation. Particularly need to spend more time mastering flexbox
      -Give buttons a visual indicator when they are a toggle
      -Update grid size label to display the actual grid size
    -A suggestion from the discord was to refactor my code to addeventlisteners to my cells once, and have the function filter based on some value. Currently I have it create/destroy event listeners as needed. I like the proposed alternative and plan to implement it after I get some more practice.
